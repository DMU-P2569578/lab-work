      <h2>Synopisis The Godfather</h2>
      <hr>
        <div class="synopsis">


      <p>The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family,
        in New York. <br> He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's,
        youngest son and a decorated <br> WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.
        Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part <br> of the family business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect <br> but
        is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous <br>
        rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito
        refuses to do it.
      </p>
      <p> What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values
        and the new ways which may cause Michael to <br> do the thing he was most
        reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia
        families <br> which could tear the Corleone family apart.</p>
